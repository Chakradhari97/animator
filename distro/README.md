# haiku-distro

Scripts and config to build+distribute Haiku

## Prerequisites

This project assumes you have Node, Git, and have developer access to Haiku's GitHub repos.

As usual, you'll need to `$ yarn install` before you begin.

You will also need Xcode command-line tools since running build scripts in several sub-projects requires it (nodegit, etc).

## Usage

For an interactive experience, just run:

    $ yarn start

    "What's new": [
      "Pro tier! For $19/month, Pro users gain the ability to store unlimited private projects on Haiku Cloud, to use Haiku without an internet connection, and to export high quality GIF animations and MP4 videos directly. (Haiku will always be free, but for Free users, some features are only available with an Internet connection, export options are limited, and only one private project is allowed.)",
      "Shape editing! Added support for directly selecting shapes inside layers/slices on Stage. Vertices of paths can also be edited on Stage, allowing for tweaking shapes outside of your design tool.",
      "Shape morphing! Now you can animate shape morphs inside Haiku. Just edit a shape's vertices on Stage, using the playhead to assign the change to each desired keyframe. Then, add tweens using the Timeline. Play the component, and watch your shapes animate.",
      "Snapping! Elements on stage now automatically snap to align with other elements, making it easier to compose elements precisely. (To turn off, hold down the Cmd key.)",
      "Align and Distribute! You can now align and distribute any set of elements on Stage. Look for the icon above the Stage and click it to open the align/distribute menu.",
      "Locking! Using the lock symbol next to the element name in the Timeline, you can now lock elements to prevent edits.",
      "Marquee selection in the Timeline! You can now select multiple keyframes/transitions in the Timeline with an easy-to-use marquee selection box, instead of manually selecting each one.",
      "Pinch zooming! Added ability for trackpad users to pinch to zoom on the Stage and in the Timeline.",
      "Copy-and-paste curves! Using the right-click context menu, you can now copy and paste curves between different transitions in the Timeline.",
      "Sync toggling! You can now prevent design changes from automatically syncing to specific elements on the Stage. Look for the sync arrow icon in the Timeline.",
      "A brand new Haiku Tour for new users! New users can select Help > Take Tour to take the new-and-improved tour.",
      "Added ability to collapse all timeline rows by collapsing the top row.",
      "Added a better visual indication of the final keyframe of the timeline.",
      "Added Cmd+Enter and Cmd+S keyboard shortcuts for saving the code in the Action editor.",
      "Added ability to use the Stage to rotate elements past a single rotation.",
      "Added a warning to make it clear that Expressions are deleted when grouping/ungrouping a set of elements.",
      "Added a save popop when switching away from the Code Editor when unsaved changes are present.",
      "Added ability to attach events to individual shapes inside slices.",
      "Added ability to change the type of a value that had been entered as a State.",
      "Added the ability to fire an Action on every frame (Action editor > Component/Lifecycle > Frame).",
      "Implemented Hover and Unhover events as a more convenient way to triggers Actions when the user hovers/unhovers an element. (You may find the behavior of these events more intuitive than Mouse Enter, Mouse Over, etc. Look for them in the Action editor under 'Favorites.')",
      "Made the property input fields in the Timeline more forgiving when the value entered doesn't match the expected type (you can now enter numbers in property fields that expect strings, for example).",
      "Improved the Library UI, making it easier to connect with your favorite design tool (Sketch, Figma, or Adobe Illustrator).",
      "Improved the component code forma to be more readable and less verbose: Element identifiers now include layer names, and non-tweened properties can be written as simple key-value pairs.",
      "Added the ability to imperatively evaluate summonables/helpers from within Action handler functions. (Try this.evaluate('$user.mouse.x').)",
      "In Lottie, changed the default background color to transparent-white (instead of transparent-black).",
      "In Lottie, added support for raster images.",
      "In Lottie, added support for groups that were created inside Haiku.",
      "In Lottie, added basic support for subcomponents that were authored and instantiated inside Haiku.",
      "In Haiku Core, removed support for legacy/deprecated properties mount.* and align.*.",
      "In Haiku Core, added support for 'auto' sizing, allowing components to be sized to their content.",
      "In Haiku Core, added support for a new $container summonable, allowing elements to be positioned according to their container's dimensions using Expressions.",
      "In Haiku Core, improved and simplified the API for various summonables. Try these: $timeline.frame, $element.width.",
      "In Haiku Core, changed the function signature for actions to (component: HaikuComponent, element: HaikuElement, target: HTMLElement, event: Event). Haiku will automatically upgrade legacy projects to use this format.",
      "In Haiku Core, added support for non-distortive sizing of subcomponents: When a component on Stage exposes numeric width and height States, resizing that subcomponent on Stage will apply changes to those fields directly (instead of applying a distortive scale).",
      "In Haiku CLI, added the ability to generate a component file. After upgrading your Haiku CLI version, run $ haiku generate."

    "Fixes": [
      "Fixed a bug preventing Frame Actions from being accounted for when determining the final keyframe/loop point in animations.",
      "Fixed issue causing both X and Y keyframes to be created when elements were only moved in one direction.",
      "Fixed a bug causing line elements from being lost during ungroup.",
      "Fixed a crash caused by copying and pasting certain components.",
      "Fixed issue causing errors when using a return statement in an Action handler function.",
      "Fixed bug in Code Editor that would cause automatic indentation to occur at unexpected times.",
      "Improved performance when horizontally scrolling in the Timeline.",
      "Improved performance when expanding/collapsing rows in the timeline.",
      "Improved performance when placing elements on the Stage.",
      "In Haiku Core, improved general animation performance.",
      "Improved error-catching to make it less likely for errors in user-authored code in Actions or Expressions to crash or appear on the Dashboard.",
      "Improved handling of values such as Infinity, null, undefined, and NaN when returned from Expressions.",
      "Fixed a number of crashes that could occur due to asset size in large projects."
